MagicCardPlayer
=============
Just a simple application I am making to allow you to play a card game similar to Magic the Gathering.  Feel free to edit and
fit the program to your wants/needs.
Works with your own cards.
This program is still in a beta with not all of the features working properly yet.

There is no affiliation between me and Wizards of the Coast LLC.  Wizards of the Coast own all rights to the 
current "logo" on the main screen and the trademark. I am currently making a new logo for the main screen.
==============
Planned Features:

- Adding your own cards to play with
- Making your own decks
- Deck Editor
- Sealed Play
- Fully functional deck player
